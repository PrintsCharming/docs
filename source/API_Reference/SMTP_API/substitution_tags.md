Hello -name-,  
 Thank you for your interest in our products. I have set up an appointment to call you at -time- EST to discuss your needs in more detail. If you would like to reschedule this call please visit the following link: [reschedule](http://sendgrid.com/reschedule?id=-customerID-) Regards, -salesContact- -contactPhoneNumber-
