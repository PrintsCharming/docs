{% info %}
The Reseller API is for companies with which SendGrid has formal reseller partnerships, such that billing and usage can be integrated. If you don't have a formal partnership with SendGrid, you will not have permission to use this API. Check the <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/Customer_Subuser_API/index.html">Customer Subuser API</a> if you need sub-account functionality. 
{% endinfo %}

<p>For compatibility with the deprecated version of this API, see documentation for <a href="{{root_url}}v1_(deprecated)/index.html">Reseller API version 1</a></p>
