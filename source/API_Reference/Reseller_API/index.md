{% info %} The Reseller API is for companies with which SendGrid has formal reseller partnerships, such that billing and usage can be integrated. If you don't have a formal partnership with SendGrid, you will not have permission to use this API. Check the [Customer Subuser API]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Customer_Subuser_API/index.html) if you need sub-account functionality. {% endinfo %}


For compatibility with the deprecated version of this API, see documentation for [Reseller API version 1]({{root_url}}v1_(deprecated)/index.html)
