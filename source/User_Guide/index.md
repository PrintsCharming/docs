SendGrid is a cloud-based [SMTP
provider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP "SMTP on Wikipedia") that
allows you to send email without having to maintain email servers.
SendGrid manages all of the technical details, from scaling the
infrastructure to ISP outreach and reputation monitoring to whitelist
services and real time analytics.

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to add reliable, scalable
email to your application so that you can focus on building the core
features of your product.

{% anchor h2 %} Who is SendGrid for? {% endanchor %}

SendGrid is for anyone that needs to send email, whether it's
transactional email or marketing emails and campaigns. We send billions
of emails each month, so we can handle your email regardless of volume.

{% anchor h3 %} Developers {% endanchor %}

For developers, it's super easy to get started. To send email through
SendGrid from your code, just change your email configuration to point
to our servers and include the credentials for your SendGrid account,
and you're done. If you're not already sending email from your app, we
have a variety of [integration
options]({{root_url}}/Integrate/index.html) for you.

Once you've got email sending squared away, check out some of the other
awesome things you can do with our
[APIs]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/index.html "SendGrid APIs") and
[apps]({{root_url}}/Apps/index.html "SendGrid Apps").

{% anchor h3 %} Marketers {% endanchor %}

Our marketing email feature lets you compose and send email campaigns
from a powerful web-based tool. We provide list management, delivery
scheduling, A/B split testing, and of course we provide analytics on the
emails you send. You can take a look at our [marketing email
documentation]({{root_url}}/Marketing_Emails/index.html "Marketing Email Documentation")
to learn more.

We also provide a robust [marketing email
API]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Marketing_Emails_API/index.html "Marketing Email API")
if you want to integrate any of these features into your own
application.
