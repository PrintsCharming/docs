SendGrid's Marketing Email tool is a powerful web and API based
interface that allows you to compose and send scheduled marketing
campaigns from your SendGrid account. Marketing Emails can be split
tested, lists can be managed, and recipients can manage their
subscriptions. You can upload your marketing email to facebook or
twitter directly from SendGrid, and much more!

For information on programmatically interfacing with SendGrid marketing
emails, check out the [Marketing Email
API]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Marketing_Emails_API) documentation.

{% info %} Sending Marketing Emails is currently available for the
Silver Plan and above. An additional charge may be applied to marketing
email sends. See the [Pricing Page](http://sendgrid.com/pricing) for
more info. {% endinfo %}
