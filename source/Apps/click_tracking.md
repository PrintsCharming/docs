Enabling the Click Tracking App causes all the links in your emails to
be overwritten and pointed to our servers so we can track clicks. If you
would like a custom name to appear in the links you can create a CNAME
that points to sendgrid.net and fill out the
[Whitelabel](http://sendgrid.com/whitelabel/) settings (only available
in Silver or higher accounts) in your account with your new name.
